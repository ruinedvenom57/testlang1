In terms of my top three favorite cards, it goes like this.

| Monster Name  | Deck          | Rank  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Blaster, Dragon Ruler of infernoes | Dragon Rulers | 1 |
| Dragun of Red-Eyes    | Dark Magician   |  2 |
| *Blue-Eyes* Alternative Dragon | *Blue-Eyes*     |   3 |

Blaster and honestly the rest of the Dragon Rulers are my favorite card is because how broken they are. Blaster effect is
>If this card is in your hand or Graveyard: You can banish a total of 2 FIRE and/or Dragon-Type monsters from your hand and/or Graveyard, except this card; Special Summon this card. During your opponent's End Phase, if this card was Special Summoned: Return it to the hand. You can discard this card and 1 FIRE monster to the Graveyard, then target 1 card on the field; destroy that target. If this card is banished: You can add 1 FIRE Dragon-Type monster from your Deck to your hand. You can only use 1 "Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos" effect per turn, and only once that turn.

This is extremely powerful as Blaster and the rest of the Dragon Rulers have very similar effects as they all use Dragons and the element of monster they are to summon themselves. That and with them having baby versions to summon them make them extremely powerful.
